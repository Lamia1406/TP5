    The Fortress of Azkaban has housed the criminals of our magical community for centuries, but its dark past has been kept from the general public. A source from inside the Ministry of Magic’s Department of Magical Law Enforcement has recently provided information that was never made privy to anyone outside of the department – until now.

Azkaban Prison sits somewhere in the North Sea, its exact location shielded from both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. But what do we truly know about this mysterious place?

Ministry officials are the only members of the Wizarding community who have ever had access to the prisons fortress. In fact, members of the Auror department who track down and detain dark wizards were the only officials who made regular visits to the prison. While Ministers of Magic were required to visit the desolate island by the description of their job, most did not, and will not.

The secrets of Azkaban prison have been guarded as closely as the high-security prisoners kept within the boundaries of the fortress itself. Built in the 16th century, its first known inhabitant was a Dark Wizard by the name of Ekrizdis.  Unbeknownst to most, Ekrizdis befouled Azkaban in ways so vulgar, ministry officials who first visited after its discovery never wished to speak of them.

As history states, Ekrizdis used his dark magic to lure muggle sailors to the island and kept them captive to be used in his experiments. His dark magic seems to have known no bounds, and many of the muggles held captive at Azkaban died while they were held prisoner there.

After Ekrizdis’s death, the concealment charms he placed on the island ‘s fortress broke, leading  to Azkaban and the island it is occupied on being discovered. The gruesome revelations of torture, despair and dark magic that took place at the bastion left many outfits in the ministry with the notion that it should be laid to waste and destroyed. On the other hand, it was feared that the Dementors would take horrible revenge on anyone who threatened the habitat they cling to and that the Dark Magic that created them may pursue an agenda of its own.

It wasn’t until after the International Statute of Secrecy was passed, and Damocles Rowle was elected as Minister of Magic that putting the fortress of Azkaban to use was discussed again.

Rowle believed that the Dementors of Azkaban would be vital to housing those who break the Wizarding laws of the new world. This notion was met with dissension as many officials felt that the Dementors of Azkaban would not be valuable allies in the years to come and wanted to proceed with the plans that had already been drafted to build a new prison on an island in the Hebrides.

Rowle argued that utilizing the fortress of Azkaban and it’s Dementors as guards would effectively save the Ministry of Magic time, trouble and expenses. Despite many expert wizards and witches opposing beliefs about re-opening Azkaban, Rowle proceeded with his agenda and the fortress was reopened for prisoner intake.

Many years later, after a visit to Azkaban during his tenure as Minister of Magic, Eldritch Diggory (1733-1747) formed a committee to make drastic changes to the Wizarding prison. Documents inside the Department of Magical Law Enforcement mention this visit that Diggory described as “horrific and abhorrent.” He went on further in his notes to state that the treatment of the prisoners was inhumane, and the levels of despair and insanity the dementors caused were unjust, regardless of what crimes earned them their sentence. Diggory campaigned diligently to put into place an alternative to Azkaban, but his plans were derailed when he died while still holding office.

In his death, Hephaestus Gore was elected as the Minister of Magic. Gore, who supported the use of Azkaban, proclaimed such by renovating the prison and even adding additional reinforcements to its structure.

Today, the use of Dementors in Azkaban Prison has earned its ominous reputation. Dementors are creatures who feed on the emotions of their victims and were often thought to be enough of a deterrent to keep the prisoners captive without the need for cells and stone walls.

The prisoners within the walls of the fortress were often driven to the point of insanity within a short time; many simply lost their will to live all together and refused meals, This lead to the wasting of their body as well as their mental fortitude. Various prisoners died during their incarceration, and those who were not claimed by family members were buried in the graveyard on the island.

Additionally, many witches and wizards who have served short sentences within Azkaban have come home with many long term effects of the mental anguish suffered during their stays at Azkaban. Many prisoners faced malnutrition during their stay. This eventually lead to changes in their physical appearances, weight loss, and mental derangement. Dementors have also been noted as being “almost combative” when it came to releasing prisoners with shorter sentences as they did not want to lose their ongoing source of food – a person’s happiness.

One such wizard gave a statement during his reintegration interview claiming severe emotional trauma.</section>","<section><h1>MAGICAL CREATURES OR NEW HEXES? MUGGLES CALLING IT COVID19</h1> In a series of unprecedented events, one right after another, the Department of Mysteries and The Department of Magical Creatures have undergone a joint collaboration to understand what the muggle world has identified as COVID19.

Interestingly enough, not a single Wizard or Witch has been known to contract what the World Health Organization has deemed a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”. Regardless of it not affecting the magical community, the department of International Magical Cooperation has been following cases of the “virus” in muggles throughout multiple countries in an attempt to understand its pattern of contraction.

When we caught up with Edward Scot, the Lead Liaison Minister, he had the following to say regarding the situation:

“At this point in time we’re not sure why The Wizarding world is not being affected by COVID19. We have no recorded cases of contractions. I do know that the Department of Mysteries is looking into how a hex may have contributed to this outbreak, and that the Department of Magical creatures is performing autopsies on deceased muggles to look for connections to any magical animals.”

In an interview, the Lead Liaison could not provide any definitive answers for The world of magic, but it is important to note that they are looking into hexes and magical creatures as viable possibilities to this malady that has muggles more frantic than Magical Community was the last time an Erumpent was set loose in Diagon Alley.

One important warning the the department of International Magical Cooperation  wishes to share with the world of magic is this:

“Even though Muggles have taken to boarding up in their homes, we must continue to adhere to the International Statute of Secrecy and safeguard our community from the Muggles. Some wizards have been seen in the empty streets of London wearing robes, using magic and failing to conceal themselves because so many Muggles seem to have gone into hiding. One group of young Wizards was even discovered by a group of Muggles playing Quidditch out in the open on the countryside! Took a whole team of Oblivators to rectify the situation. Despite these unusual times, I remind you to stay vigilant and avoid notice from the Muggle community.”

Could a Wizard or Witch have conjured a hex that only affects muggles? Is a new, un-identified magical creature responsible for the novel disease muggles and no-majs are contracting? Why is our Wizarding community immune to this pandemic?</section>","<section><h1>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A DRAGON TAMER: AN INTERVIEW WITH CHARLIE WEASLEY</h1>  
With long wavy hair as red as the fire breathed from the dragons he works with, Charlie Weasley seems like a perfect fit for the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary. Although his arms have the muscles for the job, Weasley’s dragons tower over him all the more because he isn’t nearly average height. That doesn’t stop this intrepid young man from making his home amongst the dangerous beasts.

“A lot of people misunderstand them,” Weasley tells me, standing off to the side of an enclosure where an enormous Chinese Fireball dragon is shooting fire forty feet in the air as she stomps her feet in anger because we are too close to her eggs. “They really are amazing creatures.”

Although the Chinese Fireball’s eggs are gorgeous–who wouldn’t want a bright red egg with gold specks?–they grow up into something very dangerous. Of course we all also know that dragon eggs are Class A Non-Tradable Goods. Still, I won’t say that I am not tempted to grab one when Weasley isn’t looking. If I can get past the dragon, that is.

While the eggs are impressive, that is nothing compared to the dragon itself. Weasley is certainly besotted by it, and even I have to admit that it is beautiful–in a deadly sort of way. He tells me her name is Yang, meaning “sun.” Her hide is almost impenetrable, and she is strong and fierce. She is also loyal and protective of her eggs.

Yang is an extreme scarlet color, as bright and rich as the sun for which she is named. On her back is a spectacular array of yellow spikes I do not want to meet up with. As majestic as her scales are, her deep yellow eyes are mesmerizing. The mushroom shaped flame she emits is terrifying. I do not want to get too close, no matter how much Charlie assures me it is safe.

“She knows I won’t hurt her,” he says. “And you’re with me.”

I decide not to test it. After all, he has a dragon pole in his heavily-blistered hands and I only have my quil. We go on our way, leaving the dragon to her eggs. I ask Charlie how long she has been there. He isn’t sure, but I can see by the change in his face that I have hit a sore spot.

“People try to keep them for their eggs, or their hide,” he says darkly, “especially in China. Chinese wizards use the shells from their eggs. Their hides are useful in cloaks. Kind of like Muggle armor. These are unique and marvelous beasts. They do not deserve to be hunted and misused like that. There are so few of them left.”

In fact, there are so few dragons that dragon tamers like Charlie Weasley are a bit of an endangered species themselves. At one time, wizards would have seen a dragon in the wild in Scotland or China. Now, that is a thing of the past. According to Weasley, that is for the best.

“People fear what they do not understand,” he says. “We are better off keeping them here, where they are protected from us as much as the other way around.”

Weasley has always been interested in dragons. When he was a boy at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he excelled in Care of Magical Creatures, Charms, and Herbology. He was also a Quidditch star.</section>","<section><h1>DRAGON LOOSE OVER LONDON  Dragon spotted by several muggles over London.</h1> The dragon, a Norwegian Ridgeback, was seen over Camden Town at approximately six fifteen pm this Friday night. The Ridgeback shot fire into the air in a display of anger before it flew into the air, scaring the surrounding muggles.

The muggles were dealt with by the Obliviators at the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. Before they were obliterated statements were taken.

One of the hysterical muggles said “It was so scary. I mean, dragons! They’re not supposed to be real! I thought it was going to eat me or set me on fire!”

The Ridgeback is currently being hunted by the Department of Dangerous Magical Creatures. A spokesperson for the Department commented “The dragon is leaving obvious carnage and destruction behind it, we are on its trail and confident we will be able to find it soon. I mean, there’s only so many places a dragon could be. We’re hoping it’s gone south, away from muggle inhabitants.”

This is another embarrassing blunder for the Ministry in regards to Muggles. The Statute of Secrecy is taking some serious blows and the Muggle Prime Minister has been alerted to the dangerous creature on the loose.

Once the dragon has been caught it will be taken to a refuge in Romania, headed up by the infamous Dragon Handler, Charlie Weasley. The reserve currently holds fifty dragons and two nesting mothers.

If you have any information regarding the whereabouts of the dragon please send an owl at your soonest convenience to the Department of Dangerous Magical Creatures.

More on this story as it unfolds.</section>","<section><h1>QUIDDITCH PLAYER TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR CURSING MUGGLEBORN </h1>  English Team Quidditch player has been arrested for using the Imperius Curse on a Muggleborn wizard. Reginald Thornbush, a senior English Quidditch player who has played for the past several years has been accused of using the Unforgivable curse on the, as of now, unnamed Muggleborn wizard who has asked to be kept anonymous.

The incident occurred this past All Hallows Eve at the Leaky Cauldron, the gateway to Diagon Alley. The incident has been said to have taken place due to an argument between the two men. Reginald was witnessed attempting to curse the Muggleborn after their argument became heated. Several other witches and wizards became involved, with Reginald being restrained by the Incacasterus Spell until Aurors arrived.

Auror Bones was in charge of the arrest. “We arrived at approximately 10 past 7 pm at the Leaky Cauldron after reports had been flooed in about an incident that was occurring. We arrested Mr Thornbush after witness statements showed he was attempting to use the unforgivable curse on a fellow wizard. We take this matter very seriously and his trial will be taking place shortly.”

Any use of the unforgivable curses will send the user to Azkaban with no chance of parole. The three unforgivable curses are the Imperious Curse, which allows the caster full control over the cursed, unless the aforementioned cursed wizard is able to fight it off, a feat which many are not able. The Cruciatus Curse, the torture curse, of which there is no current abilities to fight off and the Killing Curse. Only one person has ever been documented to survive the Killing Curse.

Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, is the only known survivor. There have been no other documented shield charms that can save the cursed nor any way to revive them.

When asked why the incident occurred, the anonymous wizard said “we were having a drink, we used to be good friends and I had put a bet on the upcoming England v Croatia game and just asked him how his practices were going. He flew into a rage, cursed me with the Imperius for some reason, I’m not sure what he would have made me do and I still can’t believe that he did it.”

Mr. Thornbush neglected to comment as he was taken away by Aurors.

Witnesses who were in the Leaky Cauldron at the time of the incident confirmed the anonymous wizard’s story. “They were just having a quiet chat in the back of the pub, they were laughing at the time and then all of a sudden the big guy got up and started shouting.”

While it does seem strange that the Imperius Curse was used in this incident, we can only assume that Mr. Thornbush was so enraged that he temporarily lost his mind.

A time turner is a powerful magical artifact that allows the user to travel back in time. The use of time turners has been closely watched by the Ministry since their development and the unauthorized use or creation is a criminal offense.

Sources had previously stated that all time turners had been rendered unusable during Harry Potter and his friends battle in the Department of Mysteries with the fallen He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. However an insider has confirmed that one had been created illegally, the owner arrested and the device confiscated.

All witches and wizards are aware of the consequences of meddling with time and as such should not use nor create time turners. If you are aware of any information regarding the stolen time turner please contact the Aurors office at your soonest convenient owl.

The Auror office has released an official statement in regards to the theft. “We are getting closer to finding the thief. We have several clues including a magical signature that will lead us right to them! The time turner in question is extremely dangerous and not fully functional, use of it will result in splinching in time and in extreme cases, death.”

Traveling in time has been said to lead to serious consequences, such as driving oneself mad, accidentally killing oneself and causing in-births. As such there have been strict laws regarding Time Turners since their production. The use of unauthorized Time Turner will currently sentence you to life in Azkaban.</section>","<section><h1>ST. MUNGOS HOSPITAL OPENS WARD IN HONOR OF REMUS LUPIN</h1>  There was a palpable excitement in the air Saturday morning as an enormous crowd huddled outside of St. Mungo’s Hospital amidst the torrential downpour and gusting wind.

Despite Mother Nature’s wrath on this bleak November morning, the brave souls in attendance had the excuse of a good cause to keep their spirits warm as the Remus Lupin Ward for Werewolves was opened today before a smiling portrait of the late Lycanthrope.

Many sported signs and banners of support along with steaming cups of tea as they faced the large makeshift stage where a very pale, yet very proud Edward “Teddy” Lupin stood, positively beaming out at the masses.

Teddy’s father was responsible for starting the long and very slow uplifting of ingrained prejudice and stigma towards Lycanthropes within the Wizarding Community when he valiantly died fighting to defeat the Dark Lord at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.

Before Remus’ selfless sacrifice, Werewolves were treated like a walking plague – forced to live marginalized, impoverished lives.

“It was absolutely archaic,” scoffs Jeanie Holt, head of the Department of the Control and Regulation of Magical Creatures. “People thought that Lycanthropy could be spread through something as innocuous as a handshake.”

The thirty-year-old shakes her head in what seems like pity, but she has little to feel sorry about as her 7-year struggle to transfer Werewolves into the ‘Beings’ division finally came to fruition this past summer.

“Everyone needs to remember that these people are first and foremost victims – and as Mr. Lupin reminded us – not inherently evil.”

Indeed, Remus was posthumously awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class for his truly heroic deeds and proved that his condition did not define him – nor does it define those who share his affliction.

While there is still no actual cure for Lycanthropy, the opening of the Ward at St. Mungo’s marks the first step towards advancements to make their monthly transitions as pain free as possible.

“We’ve got scores of Pain Relief and Wolfsbane Potion on hand,” says Derya Čiplak, a lovely young Adminstrator at the new Ward. “We’re hoping to make the week before and after the full moon as comfortable as we can for them.”

The Ward for Werewolves was privately funded by a group of anonymous donors and is equipped with over a hundred beds, a state of the art recreation facility and an enormous cafeteria where chocolate- recently discovered to ease the onset of mood swings before the full moon – is served alongside every meal. Moreover, the full treatment for Lycanthropes has been subsidized by the Ministry – including the cost of the once nearly unattainable Wolfsbane Potion.

The legislation was enacted following Holt’s ‘Werewolves Are Us’ Campaign, and was received with mostly positive support throughout the community.

However, there are still some who oppose the entire movement.

Why are my hard earned Galleons being spent on a day spa for some monster?” Spits John Erickson, a middle-aged office worker who is joined by a small group of like-minded protestors outside of the main crowd. “They should be helping out the average citizen, not blowing it all on potions and chocolates!”

Despite the dissent, Edward Lupin cuts the ribbon with a flourish amidst tumultuous applause as the Wizarding Community marks this momentous occasion with enthusiasm.

The twenty-year-old Hogwarts graduate and former Head Boy fought to hold back tears as he gripped tightly onto the hand of his blindingly beautiful girlfriend, Victoire Weasley – both of their fathers having been savaged by Fenrir Greyback.

The grand opening brought out many famous and familiar faces; Ron and Hermione Granger-Weasley holding hands as they cheered enthusiastically while Harry and Ginny Potter marked the moment with a warm embrace – surrounded by their clapping children. Also notably present was Draco and Scorpius Malfoy, the former standing a little further from the crowd than his bright-faced son.

All in all, the day was a success and with the next full moon on November 23rd, the staff at St. Mungo’s are looking forward to making any and all of their new patients feel welcome</section>","<section><h1>TIME TURNER BANDIT CAUGHT </h1>  Time Turners are indeed incredibly powerful artifacts and the Time Turner in question was made by an unauthorized Wizard who is currently being held on criminal charges. The original intent of its creation is not known at this time, as information and access to the maker has been restricted to anyone but Ministry Officials. The Auror Office has declined to comment further on the maker or his upcoming trial.

But the magical community can rest easily knowing that the bandit has been caught. Details are sparse at this time, but there are speculations that the thief had been caught after being splinched while attempting to use the time turner. It however was not evident as to what period of time they were attempting to visit.

“In early November the Ministry of Magic reported that an illegally made Time Turner had been stolen from the Department of Mysteries. Today we are pleased to announce that the perpetrator has been caught and is being detained in Azkaban Prison.” Reads a release from the Auror Office earlier today. “The thief was apprehended outside of the Barnton early this morning”

Anyone with any further details on this criminal act are asked to contact the Auror Office directly by owl.

The toys were colored in Hogwarts house colors, at this time we are not sure if this is a coincidence or part of the prank.

This playful plot was orchestrated perfectly during class exchange and clogged up the corridors causing the blockage of students paths.

The toys that were released are a muggle toy known as a slinky. They seem to nothing special when you look at them however when placed at the top of a staircase and tipped over, the toy seems to come alive and bound all the way down the stairs. It truly is a sight to behold.

Staff at Hogwarts have no idea how so many slinkies were brought into the school, or how many students were involved in today’s hi-jinks but the items have been added to the ever growing list of banned products that Hogwarts restricts in its hallways. All of the toys were gathered up by staff and stored in the dungeons with so many of the other confiscated items.

Parents are warned not to send any of these toys into Hogwarts via care packages, as they will likely be confiscated and your child punished.
